Ginza Server

In Japan, Ginza(銀座) is a district and also a popular upscale shopping area of Tokyo, with numerous internationally renowned department stores, boutiques, restaurants and coffeehouses located in its vicinity (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginza)). The concept of this project is to make my Google App Engine look like Ginza.
